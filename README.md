  ## Installation
  In order to use this application, first download the repository folder. You must then install node.js, if not already installed on your machine. You must also have MySQL installed and running, and will need to update you .env file to run the server.

  ## Usage
  Once the application is installed, along with node.js, run the command <npm i> to ensure that you are up to date on the require packages. You will then need to run the schema in MySQL by navigating to the root folder of project, logging into MySQL via the CLI, and then running <source db/schema.sql> in order create the database. Then, use a terminal to navigate to the project's root directory and run <npm run seed>. This will seed the database. Next, run npm start to initiate the server. Now you should be able to test the API routes, via Insomnia or browser.
